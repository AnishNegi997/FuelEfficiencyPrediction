## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about vehicle characteristics and their fuel efficiency. Key attributes include:

- Engine size
- Horsepower
- Miles per gallon (MPG)

**Source:** Add the dataset source or mention if it's synthetic.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
Include some insights from your EDA, such as:

- Correlation between engine size and fuel efficiency.
- Distribution of MPG values.
- Visualizations showing key trends and patterns.

## 🧠 Model Details
Briefly describe the models:

- **Random Forest**: High accuracy, good for handling non-linear relationships.
- **Linear Regression**: Simple, interpretable model for linear relationships.
- **KNN**: Effective for small datasets with clear patterns.

## 🚀 Results
- **Model accuracy**: Add metrics like R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.
- **Sample predictions**: Provide a few example predictions with input data.

## 🎯 Future Scope
- Extend the project to predict other vehicle parameters.
- Integrate real-time data from APIs.
- Deploy the app on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.
